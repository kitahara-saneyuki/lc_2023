# Testcase Example:  '[1,1,2]'
#
# Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each
# element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: head = [1,1,2]
# Output: [1,2]
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
# Output: [1,2,3]
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
# -100 <= Node.val <= 100
# The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
#
#

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        cur = head
        while cur:

                cur.next = cur.next.next
            else:
                cur = cur.next
